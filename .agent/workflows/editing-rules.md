# NUCLEAR BLOCK — READ BEFORE ANY ACTION

**This file MUST be read (view_file) BEFORE every single code change, file edit, or deploy.**
**If this file was not read in the current turn, NO code changes are allowed.**

## ABSOLUTE RULES — NO EXCEPTIONS

1. **Do ONLY what the user orders. NOTHING more. NOTHING less. NOTHING extra.**
2. **Never change any code, size, value, style, color, or property that was not explicitly requested.**
3. **BEFORE making ANY edit, list EXACTLY what will change and what will NOT change. WAIT for user to say "go" before touching code.**
4. **NEVER use write_to_file with Overwrite on existing files. ALWAYS use replace_file_content for targeted edits on the exact lines that need changing.**
5. **If the user asks a question, ONLY answer. Do NOT touch any code until explicitly told to.**
6. **If unsure whether something should be changed, ASK. Do not assume.**
7. **Git commit before every change so the user can revert.**
8. **NEVER deploy without confirming with the user what exactly is in the deploy.**

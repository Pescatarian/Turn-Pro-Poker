## Competitor 1: [Name TBD — Screenshots Reviewed]

### Overview
- **Platform:** iOS (likely Android too)
- **Design Style:** Dark theme, clean/flat, functional. No glassmorphism or strong brand aesthetic.
- **Target User:** Live cash game grinders (4+ sessions/week)

### Screenshots Reviewed
- Home/Dashboard, Add Session form, Sessions list, Stats/Analytics, Bankroll, Settings

### UI / Design Notes

| Element | Their Approach | Our Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard hero | Giant bankroll number, dominates screen | Ours is smaller, shares space with stats |
| Inline chart | Sparkline on home page | Chart only on bankroll tab |
| Stat cards | Two compact pills (Profit, BB/Hr) with trend arrows | Three full-width stat rows |
| Session cards | Color-coded P/L, venue photos, compact layout | Simpler cards, no photos |
| Charts | Smooth line/bar/pie charts, heatmap calendar | Basic chart on bankroll page |
| Nav | 5-tab bar with green center "+" button | 5-tab bar, "+" as separate tab |
| Add session | Stakes as tappable preset chips, map for location | Text inputs, dropdown for location |
| Overall feel | Competent but generic — no visual personality | Glassmorphism, more premium feel |

### Feature List

#### 1. Live Cash Session Tracking
| Feature | Description | Priority for Us |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent tracking bar | Live timer + profit at bottom of screen | 🔥 Must have |
| Quick re-buy/top-off | One-tap add-on during live session | 🔥 Must have |
| Lock screen widgets | Show session time without unlocking | ⚪ Skip for v1 |
| Pause/change mid-session | Change stakes or pause for break | 🟡 Post-launch |

#### 2. Financial Management & Bankrolls
| Feature | Description | Priority for Us |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple bankroll buckets | Separate funds per environment | 🟡 Post-launch |
| Transaction ledger | Non-poker expenses (tips, food, travel) | 🟡 Post-launch |
| Trip tagging | Group sessions into trips ("Vegas 2026") | 🔥 Worth adding |
| Incognito/privacy mode | Hide bankroll at the table | ✅ Already planned |

#### 3. Cash Game Analytics
| Feature | Description | Priority for Us |
|---|---|---|
| Stake-specific metrics | bb/hr breakdown per stake level | 🔥 Must have |
| Location performance | Win rates by casino/card room | 🔥 Must have |
| Punt tracking | Flag $0 cash-out sessions | 🟡 Easy win |
| Bankroll risk assessment | Suggest when to move up stakes | 🟡 Post-launch |

#### 4. Health & Performance
| Feature | Description | Priority for Us |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep impact analysis | Map P/L against sleep data | ⚪ Skip — gimmicky |
| Mindfulness metrics | Meditation habit correlation | ⚪ Skip — scope creep |
| Mental warm-up audio | Pre-session focus tools | ⚪ Skip — we have coaching |

#### 5. Automation & Utility
| Feature | Description | Priority for Us |
|---|---|---|
| Session defaults | Preset stakes/location, one-tap start | 🔥 Must have |
| Hand note macros | Templates for quick hand notes | 🟡 Nice-to-have |
| Table expense tracking | Separate rake/tips from cash-out | 🟡 Post-launch |

### Strengths
- Built for the live grinder who plays 4+ times a week
- Live session timer + re-buy is excellent UX
- Stake-specific analytics are core for serious players
- Session defaults save tons of time

### Weaknesses
- Health/wellness features feel like bloat
- No hand replayer (we have this planned)
- No coaching integration (our unique angle)
- Visual design is forgettable — no strong brand identity
